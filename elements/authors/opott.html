      <p>
        Hey! I'm Oliver, a student from the UK. I built CourseNotes to
        share my study notes and keep everything organised. My main goal
        is to help other students like me get through their courses and
        ace their exams with clear, easy-to-follow notes and retrieval
        tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently studying Computer Science and Photography at GCSE
        level, along with core subjects such as English, Maths and
        Science.
