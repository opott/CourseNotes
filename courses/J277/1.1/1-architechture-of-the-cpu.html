        <h1>The purpose of the CPU</h1>
        <p>The purpose of the CPU is to <strong>interpret & process data</strong>, as well as <strong>interpreting, processing & executing instructions</strong>.</p>
        <p>The CPU also <strong>controls the rest of the computer system</strong>.</p>
        <h2>The fetch-execute cycle</h2>
        <p>The <strong>fetch-execute cycle</strong> (sometimes referred to as the <strong>fetch-decode-execute cycle</strong>) is a cycle followed by the CPU to process an instruction.</p>
        <p>In its basic form, the cycle consists of three stages:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Fetch -</strong> The instruction is fetched from the primary memory and brought back into the CPU.</li>
                <li><strong>Decode -</strong> The instruction is broken down and decoded by the CPU, to figure out what it needs to do.</li>
                <li><strong>Execute -</strong> The instruction is actually carried out, which may involve tasks such as calculations, or storing data back into the primary memory.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h1>Common CPU components and their function</h1>
        <p>The CPU consists of many different components and registers, all with specific functions.</p>
        <h2>ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)</h2>
        <p>When the CPU executes instructions, it is often necessary to perform <strong>arithmetic calculations</strong>, or make <strong>logical decisions</strong>.</p>
        <p>This is handled by the <strong>Arithmetic Logic Unit</strong> (the ALU)</p>
        <p>The ALU performs: 
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Arithmetic Calculations -</strong> addition, subtracttion, multiplication & division</li>
                <li><strong>Logical Operations -</strong> Making a decision based on certain factors</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>CU (Control Unit)</h2>
        <p>The Control Unit controls <strong>how data moves</strong> around the CPU.</p>
        <p>It provides these functions: 
            <ol>
                <li>it <strong>fetches, decodes & executes</strong> instructions</li>
                <li>it <strong>controls hardware</strong></li>
                <li>it <strong>moves data</strong> around the computer</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>Cache</h2>
        <p>Cache is a small amount of <strong>high speed memory in the CPU</strong>.</p>
        <p>It is quicker to transfer data to and from cache memory than to and from RAM.</p>
        <p>Therefore, cache memory is used to temporarily hold data and instructions that the CPU is likely to need again.</p>
        <p>More cache memory can result in increased performance.</p>
        <h2>Registers</h2>
        <p>Registers are also <strong>small amounts of high speed memory</strong> that are used by the CPU to store data to be processed.</p>
        <p>Each register has a <strong>specific function</strong> and stores certain types of data.</p>
        <p>They store things such as: 
            <ol>
                <li>the address of the next instruction to be executed</li>
                <li>data that has been fetched or is to be stored</li>
                <li>the address where data is to be fetched from or stored to</li>
                <li>results of calulations from the ALU</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>The registers are: 
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Memory Address Register</strong> (MAR)</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Data Register</strong> (MDR)</li>
                <li><strong>Accumulator</strong> (ACC)</li>
                <li><strong>Program Counter</strong> (PC)</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>These will be explained in more detail in the Von Neumann Architechture section.</p>

        <h1>Von Neumann Architechture</h1>
        <p>The Von Neumann Architechture is the stored program concept.</p>
        <p>It is the idea that programs can be stored on the computer along with user data, allowing the functions of the program to be changed easily.</p>
        <p>Without the Von Neumann Architechture, changing a program would involve modifying complex electrical wiring inside of the computer.</p>
        <p>The main parts of the Von Neumann Architecture are:
            <ol>
                <li>data and instructions are stored as binary digits</li>
                <li>data and instructions are stored in primary memory</li>
                <li>instructions are fetched from memory, and executed in order</li>
                <li>the CPU performs the fetch-decode-execute cycle until no more instructions are available</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>MAR (Memory Address Register)</h2>
        <p>The <strong>memory address register</strong> stores the address where instructions or data are to be fetched from, or the address where data is to be transferred to.</p>
        <h2>MDR (Memory Data Register)</h2>
        <p>The <strong>memory data register</strong> stores the contents of the address in the MAR, or data to be transferred to primary memory.</p>
        <h2>Program Counter</h2>
        <p>The <strong>program counter</strong> stores the address of the next instruction to go through the fetch-decode-execute cycle.</p>
        <h2>Accumulator</h2>
        <p>The <strong>accumulator</strong> stores the data being process and the results from the arithmetic logic unit.</p>

                <p>Hi! I'm Oliver, a Computer Science student in the UK. I created CourseNotes as a way to share my learning and knowledge with the world, and help other students to do their best in their exams.</p>
                <p>I am currently studying Computer Science at GCSE level with the OCR exam board. All notes on this site will be exam board specific, but a lot of the concepts are similar across other exam boards.</p>
