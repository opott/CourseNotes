        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>This module will cover:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How common characteristics of CPUs affect their performance:
                <ul>
                    <li>Clock speed</li>
                    <li>Cache size</li>
                    <li>Number of cores</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For this topic, the specification states that you should know the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding of each characteristic listed</li>
                <li>The effects of changing any of the common characteristics on system performance, either individually or in combination</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h1>How Common Characteristics of CPUs Affect Their Performance</h1>
        <p>There are 3 main factors that affect the performance of a CPU.</p>
        <p>These factors are:
            <ul>
                <li>Clock speed</li>
                <li>Cache size</li>
                <li>Number of cores</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Clock Speed</h2>
        <p>The <strong>clock speed</strong> refers to the amount of fetch-execute cycles that can be run per second.</p>
        <p>Clock speed is measured in <strong>Hertz</strong> (Hz).</p>
        <p>More modern process operate at billions of cycles per second, which is measured in <strong>Gigahertz</strong> (GHz).</p>
        <p>For example, a processor with a 2.5GHz clock speed can perform 2.5 billion fetch-execute cycles per second!</p>
        <p>With a higher clock speed, you can expect better performance.</p>
        <h2>Cache Size</h2>
        <p><strong>Cache</strong> is a small area of high-speed memory located in the CPU.</p>
        <p>It is used for temporary storage of data and instructions currently in use.</p>
        <p>Copies of recent data and instructions are stored temporarily in the cache to make it quicker to use them again if needed.</p>
        <p>It is much quicker to fetch data from the cache than from main memory (RAM). Where possible, we try to avoid getting data from main memory as it takes too much time.</p>
        <p>Having a larger cache can lead to better performance.</p>
        <h2>Number of Cores</h2>
        <p>A CPU is usually made up of multiple processing cores.</p>
        <p>A <strong>core</strong> is essentially a processor inside of a CPU.</p>
        <p>Each core has its own processing units.</p>
        <p>Since each core is able to process one instruction at a time, having multiple cores would allow a system to process multiple instructions simultaneously.</p>
        <p>Having more cores can lead to significantly better performance, especially when multitasking.</p>
        <p>However, not all programs are able to make use of multiple cores, therefore the number of cores would not affect the way it runs.</p>

                <p>Hi! I'm Oliver, a Computer Science student in the UK. I created CourseNotes as a way to share my learning and knowledge with the world, and help other students to do their best in their exams.</p>
                <p>I am currently studying Computer Science at GCSE level with the OCR exam board. All notes on this site will be exam board specific, but a lot of the concepts are similar across other exam boards.</p>
