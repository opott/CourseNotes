        <h1>My Last Duchess</h1>
        <h2>Robert Browning</h2>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Robert Browning's My Last Duchess is a dramatic monologue, exploring
      themes of power, control and jealousy. The narrator is a Duke who shows
      his possessive nature whilst speaking about his late wife. The Duke's
      casual yet chilling tone implies that he had her killed because he lacked
      control of her emotions and interactions with others.
    </p>
    <h1>Key Words</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Monologue</b> - a long uninterrupted speech delivered by one narrator
      in the presence of others
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Jealousy</b> - a hostile attitude toward a rival who is believed to
      enjoy an advantage
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Patriarchy</b> - a society where male figures hold the power and women
      are seen as insignificant
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Power</b> - possession of control, authority and influence over others
    </p>
    <p><b>Possession</b> - something owned, occupied or controlled</p>
    <h1>Bigger Picture Idea</h1>
    <p>
      Robert Browning examines the concept of both patriarchy and political and
      social power by exploring how the speaker (the Duke) attempts to wield
      power over the domestic sphere of his marriage(s) by ensuring 'all smiles
      stopped'.
    </p>
    <h1>Analysis</h1>
    <h3>"Ferrara"</h3>
    <p>
      'My Last Duchess' by Robert Browning is a dramatic monologue, written in
      iambic pentameter. 'Ferrara' indicates the speaker is most likely Alfonso
      II d'Este.
    </p>
    <h3 class="expert-quote">
      "since none puts by the curtain I have drawn for you, but I"
    </h3>
    <p class="expert-quote">
      Even though she is dead, the Duke treats the Duchess as an item, only
      allowing select people to see the painting. He draws the curtain as a
      boast, a physical representation of the power he possesses. He can control
      who the Duchess now 'sees', which he could not do when she was alive. The
      speaker is most likely to be Alfonso II d'Este, the 5th Duke of Ferrara
      who married a 14 year old (Lucrezia) when he was 25. Alfonso's remark
      about his gift of a '900 year-old name' indicates he sees his bride
      socially beneath him. They married in 1558, he ten abandoned her for two
      years before she died aged 17 in 1561. There is a strong suspicion of
      poisoning.
    </p>
    <h3>"Looking as if she were alive"</h3>
    <p>
      Browning introduces the theme of appearance vs reality. The Duchess
      appears to be alive because the portrait of her is so well observed. In
      reality, he is consumed by the worst traits of humanity, including
      pathological jealousy and arrogance. He is obsessed with control and
      possession, evident through his use of 'my'.
    </p>
    <h3>"I gave commands; then all smiles stopped together"</h3>
    <p>
      The Duke's dangerous potential is fully realised. There is ambiguity
      surrounding the death of the Duchess yet it seems the Duke had a hand in
      her death. The use of caesura after 'together' signifies the end of life.
      His image of a tyrannical, power hungry, controlling man is complete.
    </p>
    <h1>Structure</h1>
    <p>The dramatic monologue is used to emphasise the speaker's narcissism.</p>
    <p>
      Parenthesis and rhetorical questions create the impression of natural
      speech but the fact he doesn't allow the listener to respond emphasises
      control. So do the rhyming couplets.
