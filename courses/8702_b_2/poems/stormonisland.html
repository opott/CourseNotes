        <h3>Power & Conflict Poetry (AQA 8702/B/2)</h3>
        <h1>Storm on the Island</h1>
        <h2>Seamus Heaney</h2>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Seamus Heaney's Storm on the Island explores how communities prepare for
      and endure violent storms, using this as a metaphor for political conflict
      and human vulnerability. The poet creates a tense atmosphere, showing how
      isolation and fear build as a result of the growth of nature's power.
      Dramatic imagery and conversational language highlight the contrast
      between human strength and nature's unpredictability. Themes of fear,
      conflict and uncertainty run throughout the poem.
    </p>
    <h1>Bigger Picture Idea</h1>
    <p>
      Seamus Heaney examines the concept of the hudden threat of danger and
      violence - 'the huge nothing' - by utilising the destructive porential of
      a storm as an allegory for The Troubles in Northern Ireland and their
      threat on the everyday lives of the people who lived their.
    </p>
    <h1>Analysis</h1>
    <h3 class="expert-quote">"huge nothing that we fear"</h3>
    <p class="expert-quote">
      The oxymoron 'huge nothing' draws parallels with the concept of The
      Troubles being an 'irregular war' fought on the streets of Northern
      Ireland where the distinction between friends and enemies wasn't always
      clear. It draws attention to the religious tension and could be read as a
      biblical allusuin to Matthew, questioning faith in god.
    </p>
    <h3>"This wizened earth has never troubled us"</h3>
    <p>
      This suggests complacency because nature has never troubled them before,
      which may explain the arrogance. The island has never provided - presents
      the location as bleak and empty. It is now a blessing: the storm cannot
      take away anything they rely on to survive.
    </p>
    <h3>
      "Nor are there trees which might prove company when it blows full blast"
    </h3>
    <p>
      Exposes elements of vulnerability. They are isolated, segregated from the
      rest of humanity and forced to face the storm head on. The speaker
      contemplates how isolated and exposed they are. It is clear that panic is
      begninning to take hold.
    </p>
    <h3>"You might think that the sea is company"</h3>
    <p>
      The speaker turns to something else natural for comfort, yet finds there
      is none to be found.
    </p>
    <h3>"Exploding comfortably"</h3>
    <p>
      This is an oxymoron. The residents have become accustomed to the noises
      and actions of the sea as they protect themselves in their 'squat' houses.
      Nature is unpredictable and brutal.
    </p>
    <h3>"Space is a salvo"</h3>
    <p>
      The house continues to hold. The enemy does not have to be physical to
      wield such power.
    </p>
    <h1>Structure</h1>
    <p>
      The stichic poem form mirrors the lack of control humanity has over the
      power of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caesura emphasises the ferocity of this storm and the people's
      preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enjambment allows the storm to build momentum and shows overwhelming fear.
