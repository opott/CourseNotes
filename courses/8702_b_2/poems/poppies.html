        <h1>Poppies</h1>
        <h2>Jane Weir</h2>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Jane Weir's Poppies explores the emotional impact of war from a mother's
      perspective, illustrating the pain of letting her son go off to fight.
      Domestic imagery and military references are blended to show how conflict
      affects families far away from the battlefield. Rich symbolism is used to
      express themes of loss, memory and longing.
    </p>
    <h1>Bigger Picture Idea</h1>
    <p>
      Jane Weir examines the concept of grief and suffering by exploring the
      impact of war on the maternal speaker and by extension the families of all
      soldiers who leave behind their loved ones to reminisce over 'individual
      war graves'.
    </p>
    <h1>Analysis</h1>
    <h3 class="expert-quote">"the gelled blackthorns of your hair"</h3>
    <p class="expert-quote">
      Weir uses imagery which is homely and domesticated but also highlights the
      reality of war. The noun 'blackthorns' innocently shows a young boy taking
      care of his appearance but can also be read as an allusion to Jesus' crown
      of thorns. The longjevity of the relic's survival can also be symbolic of
      the mother's memories of her son. She is worried about the potential
      sacrifice her son could be forced to make. Vulnerability and innocence can
      align them with christ.
    </p>
    <h3>
      "Three days before Armistice Sunday and poppies had already been placed on
      individual war graves"
    </h3>
    <p>
      Weir immediately foregrounds themes of war, death and personal loss. It is
      cut short by the caesura in line 3, just like the lives of the soldiers.
      Illustrates the concerns and fears if the speaker as she sends her son to
      war.
    </p>
    <h3>
      "spasms of paper red, disrupting a blockade of yellow bias binding around
      your blazer"
    </h3>
    <p>
      The poppy is unusually violent. 'Spasm' has connotations of a dying
      soldier and contrasts with the gentle image. 'Blockade' hints that their
      relationship is put on hold. 'Blazer' makes the son seem young and
      vulnerable.
    </p>
    <h3>"Sellotape bandaged around my hand"</h3>
    <p>
      This alludes to the brutal consequences of war. It shows the mother's
      maternal duty to care for her son. 'Sellotape' is juxtaposed with
      'bandaged' to show the different paths the mother and her son are taking.
      Her life's purpose is to care for him.
    </p>
    <h3>
      "the front door, threw it open, the world overflowing like a treasure
      chest"
    </h3>
    <p>
      'Treasure chest' has connotations of adventure - it emphasises the son's
      naivety. The son lacks life experience as his mother has always protected
      him. This acts as an allusion to Pandora's Box - the house is safe but
      when the door is opened, he is not protected.
    </p>
    <h1>Structure</h1>
    <p>Free verse mimics the unstructured thoughts of a grieving mother.</p>
    <p>
      Enjambment is symbolic of a mother passionately lamenting the loss of her
      child.
    </p>
