        <h3>Power & Conflict Poetry (AQA 8702/B/2)</h3>
        <h1>The Charge of the Light Brigade</h1>
        <h2>Alfred Lord Tennyson</h2>
      </div>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Alfred Lord Tennyson's The Charge of the Light Brigade is a poem
      commemorating the bravery of British soldiers during the Crimean War. It
      recounts how the Light Bridage followed a flawed command, charging into
      their death. Themes of honour, duty and sacrifice highlight the soldiers'
      unwavering courage. Whilst acknowledging the tragic loss, the poem
      ultimately celebrates the soldiers' heroism and loyalty.
    </p>
    <h1>Bigger Picture Idea</h1>
    <p>
      Alfred Lord Tennyson examines the concept of chivalry and self sacrifice
      through his depiction of the Light Bridage's 'glory', subservience and
      loyalty in the Crimean War and as a by-produce romanticises, glamourises
      and enthrones war.
    </p>
    <h1>Analysis</h1>
    <h3 class="expert-quote">"Some one had blunder'd"</h3>
    <p class="expert-quote">
      The use of the word 'blundered' is pertinent as it mirrors an editorial in
      the Times from 1854. He is appalled at the loss of life as a result of
      human error. Tennyson is not impressed with the higher authority yet
      avoids directly blaming one person.
    </p>
    <h3>"Half a league onward, all in the valley of Death"</h3>
    <p>
      This is a biblical allusion from psalm 23, suggesting horror and
      segregation from god. It is a reference to the stoical bravery of the
      soldiers - they knew they were going to die, but do not fear it and
      fulfill their patrotoc duty.
    </p>
    <h3>
      "Cannon to the right of them, cannon to the left of them, cannon in front
      of them"
    </h3>
    <p>
      The usage of anaphora emphasises the impossible odds that these men are
      fighting against. A cannon has destructive potential. The men are being
      herded by the enemy and are likely to die wherever they go.
    </p>
    <h3>"Into the jaws of Death, into the mouth of Hell"</h3>
    <p>
      This biblical allusion suggests these soldiers are completely consumed by
      the hellish realities of war. Fate and the fact that their deaths are
      inevitable become strikingly clear. Blunder is closing around them and
      they cannot escape it.
    </p>
    <h3>"All that was left of them"</h3>
    <p>
      A tragic image portrays this unified force as broken and fragile. It shows
      the unwavering and resolute manner in which the men complete their orders.
      A poignant tribute to those who had no choice but to ride to their deaths.
    </p>
    <h3>
      "Honour the charge they made! Honor the Light Brigade, noble six hundred!"
    </h3>
    <p>
      This quote uses imperatives. The poem never differentiates between those
      who did and did not survive. They are united in their patriotism and duty
      and should be respected and acknowledged.
    </p>
    <h1>Structure</h1>
    <p>
      Together with the use of dactylic dimeter, in which the heavy stress falls
      on monosyllabic words, auditory imagery and momentum of cavalry charge is
      created.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shift in structure reflects their desperate attempt to retrat. We are
      reminded of the soldiers' heroism.
