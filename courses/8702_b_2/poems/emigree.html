        <h3>Power & Conflict Poetry (AQA 8702/B/2)</h3>
        <h1>The Emigrée</h1>
        <h2>Carol Rumens</h2>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Carol Rumens' The Emigrée explores the lasting impact of exile and the
      powerful connections between identity and a place. The speaker reflects on
      a city they left as a child - remembering it positively, despite the fact
      it may now be dangerous or forbidden. Rumens uses light to show how
      nostalgia can preserve an idealised version of home. Themes of
      displacement, memory and resilience are present throughout the poem.
    </p>
    <h1>Key Words</h1>
    <p><b>Nostalgia</b> - the state of being homesick</p>
    <p><b>Exile</b> - the state of being barred from one's native country</p>
    <p><b>Homeland</b> - the native land of oneself or one's ancestors</p>
    <p><b>Memory</b> - recollection of past experiences</p>
    <p><b>Oppression</b> - unjust or cruel exercise of authority or power</p>
    <h1>Bigger Picture Idea</h1>
    <p>
      Carol Rumens examines the concept of hope through the irrational yet
      optimistic perception of the migrant speaker who has been 'branded by the
      impression of sunlight' and affection despite war and tyranny in their
      homeland.
    </p>
    <h1>Analysis</h1>
    <h3 class="expert-quote">
      "It may be at war, it may be sick with tyrants"
    </h3>
    <p class="expert-quote">
      Rumens contrasts how the eye of childhood is unable to reconcile the
      horrific truth of war and tyranny in her homeland with the speaker's own
      idealised 'taste of sunlight'. It creates a body politic metaphor and
      emphasises the sympathy and connection with the character's homeland. The
      country is 'sick' and the disease is curable, despite the transient nature
      of a tyrant's power.
    </p>
    <h3>"There once was a country..."</h3>
    <p>
      The ellipsis may suggest this country no longer exists in the form she
      remembers. She is desperate to portray the country in a positive light.
      Her view may be positive but she cannot deny that it is tainted and
      ruined.
    </p>
    <h3>"but I am branded by an impression of sunlight"</h3>
    <p>
      The motif of sunlight is used to represent positive memories. 'Sunlight'
      has connotations of warmth. This positivity is juxtaposed by the brutal
      verb 'branded'. She cannot and will not shake her 'original view'.
    </p>
    <h3>"Soon I shall have every coloured molecule of it"</h3>
    <p>
      This suggests that her former home was a totalitarian state and that
      freedom of speech was curtailed. The words she was forbidden to speak are
      still within her. She argues that she will have that language back in full
      again soon.
    </p>
    <h3>"My city takes me dancing through the city of walls"</h3>
    <p>
      The city is treated as two separate entities. It allows her to
      metaphorically dance through the city as it is now. Ideas of freedom and
      restriction are juxtaposed. It is likely that such an action would be
      banned under tyrannical rule. Could this represent defiance?
    </p>
    <h3>"They mutter death. and my shadow falls as evidence of sunlight"</h3>
    <p>
      Creates an image of oppression, evil and hatred. They are trying to
      maintain the utopian image they have forged. No matter how powerful the
      tyrants are, there is always some form of hope.
    </p>
    <h1>Structure</h1>
    <p>
      The use of free verse and a lack of rhyme or stanza structure perhaps
      communicates the speaker's lack of control.
    </p>
    <p>
      It could alternatively show a kind of freedom that the speaker has in the
      moments of more positive imagery.
