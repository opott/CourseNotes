        <h3>Power & Conflict Poetry (AQA 8702/B/2)</h3>
        <h1>Tissue</h1>
        <h2>Imtiaz Dharker</h2>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Imtiaz Dharker's Tissue explores the fragility and power of paper as a
      metaphor for human life. The poem reflects on how paper shapes our world,
      yet is ultimately delicate and temporary. Dharker uses gentle imagery to
      suggest that human creations are not as permanent as we may think. Tissue
      invites readers to let go of control, embracing the transient, precious
      nature of life.
    </p>
    <h1>Key Words</h1>
    <p><b>Fragility</b> - easily broken or destroyed</p>
    <p><b>Structure</b> - to form into or according to a structure</p>
    <p>
      <b>Transience</b> - passing especially quickly into and out of existence;
      always changing
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Metaphor</b> - a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied
      to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Identity</b> - the distinguishing character or personality of an
      individual
    </p>
    <h1>Bigger Picture Idea</h1>
    <p>
      Imtiaz Dharker examines the concept of power by describing how paper, and
      its various usages, can be so fragile and yet yield the power to 'alter
      things' in much the same way as a mortal human life can.
    </p>
    <h1>Analysis</h1>
    <h3 class="expert-quote">
      "the kind you find in well-used books, the back of the Koran"
    </h3>
    <p class="expert-quote">
      This quote is symbolic of the power of paper in books, especially
      religious texts. The power of books can far outlast humanity's sense of
      power.
    </p>
    <h3>
      "Paper that lets the light shine through, this is what could alter things"
    </h3>
    <p>
      The poem opens with an image of beauty and positivity, the idea that as
      long as we have light there is potential for change for the better. It has
      religious connotations; belief in God suggests redemption and purity.
    </p>
    <h3>"pages smoothed and stroked and turned transparent with attention"</h3>
    <p>
      The paper is worn thin because it is used frequently. 'Turned transparent
      with attention' suggests that we can learn more and see deeper the more we
      examine our lives and grow mature. Paper controls how we live and outlasts
      us.
    </p>
    <h3>
      "Fine slips from grocery shops that say how much was sold and what was
      paid by credit card might fly our lives like paper kites"
    </h3>
    <p>
      This simile explores the importance humanity places on paper. We value
      freedom but remain controlled like a kite. Receipts and money dictate how
      we live our lives. It shows how preoccupied we are with material goods.
      There is too much emphasis on unimportant things rather than working
      towards a greater good.
    </p>
    <h1>Structure</h1>
    <p>
      A controlled structure (9 quatrains) could represent the control paper has
      over us and the knowledge it holds.
    </p>
    <p>Enjambment is symbolic of the impact of paper.</p>
