        <h3>Power & Conflict Poetry (AQA 8702/B/2)</h3>
        <h1>Remains</h1>
        <h2>Simon Armitage</h2>
      </div>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Simon Armitage's Remains is a disturbing poem exploring the psychological
      impact of war on soldiers. It is based on a real account of a British
      soldier's experiences serving in Iraq and describes the moment he killed a
      looter and the lasting trauma that followed. The poet uses conversational
      language to show the lingering violent memories, long after it happened.
      Themes of guilt, memory and PTSD are present.
    </p>
    <h1>Key Words</h1>
    <p><b>PTSD</b> - post-traumatic stress disorder</p>
    <p><b>Guilt</b> - a feeling of responsibility for wrongdoing</p>
    <p><b>Colloquial</b> - using conversational style</p>
    <p><b>Haunting</b> - having qualities that linger in the memory</p>
    <p>
      <b>Desensitisation</b> - to extinguish an emotional response to stimuli
      which formerly induced it
    </p>
    <h1>Bigger Picture Idea</h1>
    <p>
      Simon Armitage examines the concept of PTSD on the lives of young soldiers
      in the brutal aftermath of war by contrasting the colloquial friendliness
      of the speaker with the 'bloody' depiction of his violent and intrusive
      memories.
    </p>
    <h1>Analysis</h1>
    <h3 class="expert-quote">"End of story, except not really"</h3>
    <p class="expert-quote">
      This is the poem's volta. The violent acts begin to mentally affect the
      narrative voice of the poem. Colloquial expressions such as 'I swear' and
      'legs it' create a conversational tone. Armitage alludes to the long term
      effects of PTSD and explores the effects of the Iraq war on ex-soldiers.
      The volta is used to contrast the narrator's friendliness with the
      brutality of war.
    </p>
    <h3>"On another occasion, we get sent out"</h3>
    <p>
      The soldiers are seemingly controlled by an unseen superior. They do not
      question authority. The poem begins in media res. The occasion has
      obviously stuck in the speakers mind, making it significant.
    </p>
    <h3>"I see every round as it rips through his life"</h3>
    <p>
      This shows the true horrors of war. We are presented with a gruesome image
      of bullets destroying a life, implying how fragile life is, and how it is
      so easy to take away. Ripping something takes little effort and always
      leads to destruction.
    </p>
    <h3>"tosses his guts back into his body"</h3>
    <p>
      The verb 'tosses' is nonchalant; there are no real ramifications to death
      - not immediately anyway. The men have become so desensitised by war they
      they have no qualms when throwing guts back into bodies. This shows a
      casual action - these men are not the same as they used to be.
    </p>
    <h3>"and he bursts again through the doors of the bank"</h3>
    <p>
      Shows a sense of urgency. This connotes aggression and anger, posing a
      threat to the soldiers. The verb 'bursts' could also link to PTSD; there
      is no warning to the anxiety, making it crippling.
    </p>
    <h3>"And the drink and the drugs won't flush him out"</h3>
    <p>
      The speaker is so haunted that he is desperate to cleanse himself,
      ironically using harmful substances. He is lost.
    </p>
    <h3>"his bloody life in my bloody hands"</h3>
    <p>
      The speaker could be swearing, reflecting the frustration he feels, or he
      could be talking about actual blood. He feels huge amounts of guilt.
    </p>
    <h1>Structure</h1>
    <p>
      Armitage uses a monologue form and unrhymed quatrains to show how the
      speaker cannot get rid of the image of killing someone. Representative of
      the disintegration of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lack of rhythmic pattern and enjambment adds a sense of being told a
      story fairly naturally.
