        <h3>Power & Conflict Poetry (AQA 8702/B/2)</h3>
        <h1>Exposure</h1>
        <h2>Wilfred Owen</h2>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Wilfred Owen's Exposure focuses on the harsh, relentless conditions faced
      by soldiers in the trenches during World War I. Owen highlights the deadly
      power of nature as the true enemy. Themes of suffering, hopelessness and
      futility run throughout the poem.
    </p>
    <h1>Key Words</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Futility</b> - serving no useful purpose; ineffective
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Trench</b> - a long, narrow ditch used in warfare
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Personification</b> - representation of a thing or abstraction as a person
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Suffering</b> - a pain endured
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Despair</b> - utter loss of hope
    </p>
    <h1>Bigger Picture Idea</h1>
    <p>
      Wilfred Owen examines the concept of the dehumanisation of soldiers in
      World War One by deglamourising and dethroning war, and graphically
      depicting the debilitating effects of nature's 'melancholy army' on their
      chances of survival.
    </p>
    <h1>Analysis</h1>
    <h3 class="expert-quote">"But nothing happens"</h3>
    <p class="expert-quote">
      Owen was aware that his generation was living through horrors. It was so
      horrific that poetry was needed to describe the realities of war. He
      reinforces that 'nothing happens', highlighting that nothing is achieved
      by them being there. There is no honour in death. Instead, soldiers
      experience a slow, excruciating death, inflicted upon them by the power of
      nature.
    </p>
    <h3>"Our brains ache, in the merciless iced east winds that knive us"</h3>
    <p>
      Owen opens with an image of utmost brutality. It has connotations of
      stabbing and extreme pain. The enemies in the east are on a more
      metaphorical level. 'Us' is placed on a new line to highlight the
      vulnerability of the soldiers.
    </p>
    <h3>"..."</h3>
    <p>
      Owen's consistent use of ellipsis creates a sense of foreboding. It could
      be argued that it symbolises a sense of urgency felt within the soldiers.
      They are trained for war but they are waiting, fighting the cold.
    </p>
    <h3>"Pale flakes with fingering stealth come feeling for our faces"</h3>
    <p>
      This is a personification of snow. Owen hints that nature itself is
      targeting the soldiers. They don't even realise the extent to which the
      cold is killing them. It draws attention to the excruciating pain that the
      delicate flakes can actually cause.
    </p>
    <h3>"For love of God seems dying"</h3>
    <p>
      War shatters the faith of the men. They have mentally and physically
      changed. In the horrors that they have seen, there is an absence of
      goodness. The cold is ageing them and they are unable to recognise
      themselves.
    </p>
    <h3>"All their eyes are ice"</h3>
    <p>
      Representative of the unimaginable suffering they are expected to endure.
      It demonstrates how their lives have been snatched from them. The soldiers
      are dying and yet 'nothing happens' as a result. They are left to follow
      the orders of those deemed superior.
    </p>
    <h1>Structure</h1>
    <p>
      The irregular ABBA rhyme scheme creates a sense of stasis to emphasise
      their unchanging lives.
    </p>
    <p>Repetition is used to emphasise the futility.</p>
    <p>Para-rhymes unsettle the reader.</p>
