        <h1>Ozymandias</h1>
        <h2>Percy Bysshe Shelley</h2>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Percy Bysshe Shelley's Ozymandias is a sonnet exploring the themes of
      power, pride and the decline of rulers. The narrator describes a ruined
      statue in a desert that once belonged to a kind who believed his empire
      would be everlasting. However, time has erased his legacy and the remains
      of the statue stand as a reminder of human arrogance and the fleeting
      power of nature.
    </p>
    <h1>Key Words</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Tyranny</b> - a government in which absolute power is vested in a
      single ruler
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Legacy</b> - the long lasting impact of a particular event or person
    </p>
    <p><b>Hubris</b> - exaggerated pride or self-confidence</p>
    <p><b>Ruin</b> - to damage irreparably</p>
    <p><b>Impermanence</b> - the quality or state of not being permanent</p>
    <p>
      <b></b>
    </p>
    <h1>Bigger Picture Idea</h1>
    <p>
      Percy Shelley examines the concept of the transient nature of power
      through an allegorical depiction of the boastful, hubristic and
      narcissistic Ramses II and the limitations of his 'cold command' and
      authoritarian rule.
    </p>
    <h1>Analysis</h1>
    <h3>"Ozymandias" - the title</h3>
    <p>
      'Ozy' comes from the Greek 'ozium' which means either 'to breathe' or
      'air'. 'Mandias' comes from the Greek 'mandate' which means to rule,
      suggesting Ramses II, the inspiration for Shelley's poem, controls all.
    </p>
    <h3 class="expert-quote">"stamped on these lifeless things"</h3>
    <p class="expert-quote">
      Shelley's ridicule of the pharaoh's arrogant boast could be veiled
      condemnation of the government under George III. The poet abhorred
      oppressive monarchical government, favouring revolution. This could act as
      a warning that Britain could expect the same if it didn't change. The
      king's sons were objects of public scorn amd the country was run for
      selfish interests. People are hungry and oppressed - the army stamps on
      the proletariat and destroys liberty.
    </p>
    <h3>
      "Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown and wrinkled lip, and
      sneer of cold command"
    </h3>
    <p>
      The 'frown' and 'sneer' etched permanently on the face of the statue could
      represent the ugliness that power can reveal in people when they wield it.
      Shelley is criticising the oppressive nature of power.
    </p>
    <h3>"its sculptor well those passions read which yet survive"</h3>
    <p>
      The traveller praises the sculptor saying they have clearly captured the
      facial expressions Ozymandias is renowned for. Shelley is praising and
      respectful of the 'art' of the statue whilst condemning Ozymandias'
      attitude and lust for power. He is saying that it is the work of the
      sculptor that has endured the test of time.
    </p>
    <h3>
      "'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: look on my works, ye Mighty, and
      despair!'"
    </h3>
    <p>
      The hubristic nature of Ozymandias demonstrates his arrogance and
      perceived superiority, placing himself above other rulers. Iambic
      pentameter creates a strong rhythm for a strong leader. It demonstrates
      that art and language can long outlast other legacies of power.
    </p>
    <h1>Structure</h1>
    <p>
      Shelley uses the sonnet form which is associated with love to evoke
      Ozymandias' narcissism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rhyme scheme becomes even more irregular throughout the poem,
      emphasising the degradation of power.
