        <h3>Power & Conflict Poetry (AQA 8702/B/2)</h3>
        <h1>War Photographer</h1>
        <h2>Carol Ann Duffy</h2>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Carol Ann Duffy's War Photographer explores the emotional conflict faced
      by war photographers. The poem follows a photographer developing photos in
      a darkroom, reflecting on the horrors he has witnessed and the
      indifference of people back home. She contrasts the chaos of the
      battlefield with the safety of rural England. Throughout the poem, themes
      of suffering, guilt and detachment and present. Duffy questions the role
      of media and the impact of war on victims and observers.
    </p>
    <h1>Bigger Picture Idea</h1>
    <p>
      Carol Ann Duffy examines the concept of distant wars, suffering and the
      'hundred agonies' of those caught up in the conflict and questions the
      reasons behind the desensitisation of the western populous towards such
      atrocities.
    </p>
    <h1>Analysis</h1>
    <h3 class="expert-quote">"All flesh is grass"</h3>
    <p class="expert-quote">
      Priests who 'intone a mass' are typically associated with tragedies. The
      similie therefore reminds us of the grave consequences of war and the
      impact on those far away. It is a quote from the bible reflecting on the
      shortness of human life. It is also an extended metaphor examines the
      responsibility of a war photographer or anyone who profits from suffering.
    </p>
    <h3 class="expert-quote">"running children in a nightmare heat"</h3>
    <p class="expert-quote">
      'Running children' creates a pathos as children connote innocence.
      'Nightmare heat' is emblematic of their childhood fears. This poem is
      inspired by Nick Ut's Pulitzer Prize winning photo of 'Napalm Girl', which
      may have been used as an allusion; a symbol of human tragedy and to shed a
      light upon innocent victims of war.
    </p>
    <h3>"In his darkroom he is finally alone"</h3>
    <p>
      This quote emphasises the silence and solitude experienced by the
      photographer. The adverb 'finally' suggests that this is something he has
      longed for after the chaos and pain of war. The 'darkroom' could have a
      deeper, symbolic meaning. He has shut off the light, yet it could be a
      physical manifestation of the darkest recesses of his mind. The
      photographs are forcing him to revisit the trauma.
    </p>
    <h3>"A hundred agonies in black-and-white"</h3>
    <p>
      The emotions behind each photo are complex and painful, full of
      powerlessness and hopelessness. Where before the photographer was giving
      victims of war a voice, the majority will be solenced because not all
      photographs will be chosen for publication.
    </p>
    <h3>
      "From the aeroplane he stares impassively at where he earns his living and
      they do not care"
    </h3>
    <p>
      The photographer returns from the battlefield - as long as there is
      conflict, he is needed. The adverb 'impassively' shows he is used to
      people not caring. He will continue trying to find a solution, despite the
      fact that there are no solutions to war.
    </p>
    <h1>Structure</h1>
    <p>
      The ABBCDD rhyming scheme imitates the rigidity of the photographer's job
      in contrast to his mind.
    </p>
    <p>Caesura emphasises the harrowing effect his job has on him.</p>
    <p>The poem's volta deploys analepsis.</p>
