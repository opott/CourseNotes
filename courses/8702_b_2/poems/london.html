        <h3>Power & Conflict Poetry (AQA 8702/B/2)</h3>
        <h1>London</h1>
        <h2>William Blake</h2>
      </div>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      William Blake's London is a critical poem that exposes the suffering and
      oppression in London during the late 18th century. Whilst 'wandering'
      through the streets, the narrator highlights themes of poverty, corruption
      and the loss of freedom. Society is trapped by injustice. The use of rigid
      structure and repetition reinforce ideas of control and restriction.
    </p>
    <h1>Key Words</h1>
    <p><b>Oppression</b> - unjust or cruel exercise of authority or power</p>
    <p>
      <b>Charter'd</b> - the state of everything being mapped out and controlled
    </p>
    <p><b>Corruption</b> - dishonest conduct especially by those in power</p>
    <p>
      <b>Proletariat</b> - the lowest social or economic class of a community;
      the working class
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Industrialisation</b> - the widespread development of industries in a
      region
    </p>
    <h1>Bigger Picture Idea</h1>
    <p>
      William Blake examines the concept of the oppressive and claustrophobic
      presence of authoritarian rule in the lives of London's proletariat -
      whilst promoting revolution as a means of escape from their 'mind-forged
      manacles'.
    </p>
    <h1>Analysis</h1>
    <h3 class="expert-quote">"Runs in blood down palace walls"</h3>
    <p class="expert-quote">
      Blake explores poverty, revolution and the power of imagination. The
      French Revolution was a moment of radical hope turned into violent
      disillusion. He was initially a supporter and wore a 'bonnet rouge' in 1792
      to show his solidarity with the revolutionaries abroad. The cap symbolised
      freedom from tyranny and became an icon of the French Revolution. Nobody
      doubted Blake's revolutionary sympathies.
    </p>
    <h3>
      "I wander through each chartered street, near where the chartered Thames
      does flow"
    </h3>
    <p>
      Here, Blake is criticising the lack of freedom those in London are forced
      to endure. The adjective 'chartered' implies everything has been mapped -
      everything has been 'chartered' and must submit to this charter, including
      the natural river Thames. Repetition reinforces control and the verb
      'wander' implies that the narrator feels misguided in this strict city.
    </p>
    <h3>"The mind-forged manacles I hear"</h3>
    <p>
      The lack of faith in change is a source of frustration for Blake. He
      alludes to a possible revolution in London, suggesting the horrible
      experiences living there could lead to it. Blake was a huge supporter of
      the French Revolution and saw it as a model for how ordinary,
      disadvantaged people could seize power.
    </p>
    <h1>Structure</h1>
    <p>
      Blake utilises a regular structure to emphasise control and contrast with
      the relative freedom of the narrator who is able to 'wander' around the
      city at leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poem consists of 4 quatrains, each with end-stopped lines at the end.
    </p>
    <p>It follows an ABAB rhyme scheme.</p>
