        <h3>Power & Conflict Poetry (AQA 8702/B/2)</h3>
        <h1>Extract from, The Prelude</h1>
        <h2>William Wordsworth</h2>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      William Wordsworth's The Prelude is a reflective poem, exploring the
      relationship between humanity and nature. This extract describes a young
      boy's experience of rowing a stolen boat. He initially feels excited and
      powerful, before being overwhelmed by the vastness of nature. The poet
      highlights themes of guilt, awe and the sublime by using vivid imagery to
      capture the speaker's changing emotions to emphasise the idea that nature
      shapes human experiences.
    </p>
    <h1>Key Words</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Sublime</b> - implies that despite the beauty of nature, it can also be
      dangerous
    </p>
    <p><b>Awe</b> - a feeling of mixed fear, respect and wonder</p>
    <p><b>Solitude</b> - the quality or state of being isolated from society</p>
    <p><b>Guilt</b> - a feeling of responsibility for wrongdoing</p>
    <p><b>Reflection</b> - reminiscing on past experiences and their impact</p>
    <h1>Bigger Picture Idea</h1>
    <p>
      William Wordsworth examines the concept of 'rapture' in the face of the
      awe-inspiring phenomena of nature and the physical world and explores how
      this pantheism can contribute to the development of a poet's mind and
      conscience.
    </p>
    <h1>Analysis</h1>
    <h3 class="expert-quote">"Towered up between me and the stars"</h3>
    <p class="expert-quote">
      According to Wordsworth, The Prelude is 'a poem on the growth of my own
      mind' with 'contrasting views on Man, Nature and Society'. He uses
      celestial imagery to magnify his won comparative self-confidence in the
      face of nature. In contrast, upon reaching the mountain the speaker
      becomes awestruck beyond all comprehension as to what it could be. The
      celestial image is now blocked out by the mountains. Stars are used for
      navigation, signifying there is no chance of man and nature co-existing.
      He uses the mountain to represent nature's power over man and captures the
      maturation of his adult mind.
    </p>
    <h3>"One summer evening (led by her)"</h3>
    <p>
      Reveals that it was nature that led him to the boat. The boat becomes
      personified and the speaker imagines himself as chivalric, liberating what
      he has found from 'her chain'. He is confident, forceful, perhaps arrogant
      in his ability to take control.
    </p>
    <h3>
      "Small circles glittering idly in the moon, until they melted all into one
      track of sparkling light"
    </h3>
    <p>
      Nature is presented here as beautiful. The speaker is lulled into a false
      sense of security; nature could never be a threat. 'Glittering' and
      'sparkling' could be described as celestial. It is a heavenly vision, one
      that the speaker is comfortable with, and one that fuels his arrogance.
    </p>
    <h3>
      When, from behind that craggy steep till then the horizon's bound, a huge
      peak, black and huge"
    </h3>
    <p>
      The adjective 'craggy' shatters the image of delicacy established earlier
      in the poem. This is the poem's volta, which lingers in the word 'when',
      reveals the dramatic change in the speaker's thoughts and emotions. Simple
      adjectives describe te mountain he sees. 'Huge' and 'black' contrast
      significantly to 'glittering' and 'sparkling'. This represents the
      speaker's confusion and bewilderment.
    </p>
    <h3>"Upreared its head"</h3>
    <p>
      This makes the mountain sound animalistic, as if nature has been disturbed
      and is defending itself.
    </p>
    <h3>"Stole my way back to the covert of the willow tree"</h3>
    <p>
      He is fearful of the power that nature has had over him. The 'covert' or
      cove could initially symbolise safety and security, yet it has been
      tainted by the man's actions and what he has seen.
    </p>
    <h3>"were a trouble to my dreams"</h3>
    <p>
      The dreamlike imagery of the opening is replaced with a nightmarish view
      of nature. It creates an unsettling image to demonstrate how nature has
      scolded the speaker. There is disillusionment and disempowerment. The
      speaker has experience the untameable power of nature.
    </p>
    <h1>Structure</h1>
    <p>
      The choice of the epic poem form adds a sense of gravitas to what could be
      viewed as a mundane childhood memory.
    </p>
    <p>Blank verse contributes to natural speech and spiritual growth.</p>
    <p>Caesura shows how the relationship between man and nature is broken.</p>
